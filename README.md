## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to analyze transportation data with a focus on making roads safer for **vulnerable road users**. It follows a structured approach with **six milestones**, each guiding learners through transportation research and data science methodologies.

Participants explore traffic patterns, accident data, and apply data science techniques to derive insights that can improve road safety.

For a detailed overview of the project, visit the [TDSP Webpage](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/tdsp/).
